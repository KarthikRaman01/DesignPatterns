Creational Patterns:

Most important: You are programming to an interface.

Factory Pattern
1) Creation of Objects
2) Factory methods are responsible for creation of objects.
3) Three methods - abstract creator, concrete creator, static creator

Example:

One family --> one interface --> ex: shape
child classes that implements that interface --> ex: rectangle, square etc
Factory class that is abstract --> has a factory method --> responsible for creation of right objects.
